<PageHeader title="Links and Navigation" />

rari takes a different approach to navigation. Instead of requiring a special `<Link>` component, you use standard HTML `<a>` tags. The framework's client router automatically intercepts link clicks and performs client-side navigation — giving you the benefits of a single-page application without the API overhead.

## Basic Usage

Just use regular anchor tags:

<CodeBlock filename="src/app/page.tsx" language="tsx">{`export default function HomePage() {
  return (
    <nav>
      <a href="/">Home</a>
      <a href="/about">About</a>
      <a href="/blog">Blog</a>
    </nav>
  )
}
`}</CodeBlock>

That's it. No imports, no special components, no learning curve. If you know HTML, you know how to navigate in rari.

## How It Works

When you click a link, rari's client router:

1. Intercepts the click event on `<a>` tags
2. Prevents the default browser navigation
3. Fetches only the new page content (not the entire HTML document)
4. Updates the URL in the browser
5. Streams the new content into the page
6. Preserves layout state and scroll position

This gives you instant navigation with no full-page reloads, while keeping your code simple and standards-based.

## Client-Side Navigation Benefits

### Layout Preservation

Layouts don't re-render during navigation. If you have a sidebar, header, or any shared UI in a layout component, it stays mounted and preserves its state:

<CodeBlock filename="src/app/dashboard/layout.tsx" language="tsx">{`import { useState } from 'react'
import type { LayoutProps } from 'rari'

export default function DashboardLayout({ children }: LayoutProps) {
  const [sidebarOpen, setSidebarOpen] = useState(true)

  return (
    <div>
      <aside>
        {/* This sidebar state persists across page navigation */}
        <button onClick={() => setSidebarOpen(!sidebarOpen)}>
          Toggle
        </button>
        <nav>
          <a href="/dashboard">Overview</a>
          <a href="/dashboard/analytics">Analytics</a>
          <a href="/dashboard/settings">Settings</a>
        </nav>
      </aside>
      <main>{children}</main>
    </div>
  )
}
`}</CodeBlock>

Navigating between `/dashboard/analytics` and `/dashboard/settings` only swaps the page content — the sidebar stays mounted with `sidebarOpen` intact.

### Streaming Updates

Only the changed content is fetched and streamed. If you navigate from `/blog` to `/blog/hello-world`, rari fetches just the blog post page, not the entire document with layouts and navigation.

### Optimized Performance

The router includes built-in optimizations:
- Debounced navigation to prevent rapid-fire requests
- Automatic request cancellation when navigating away
- Route info caching to avoid redundant fetches
- Scroll position restoration on back/forward navigation

## Styling Links

Since links are just `<a>` tags, style them however you want — CSS, Tailwind, CSS modules, styled-components, anything:

<CodeBlock filename="src/app/components/Navigation.tsx" language="tsx">{`export default function Navigation() {
  return (
    <nav className="flex gap-4">
      <a
        href="/products"
        className="px-4 py-2 text-gray-700 hover:text-gray-900 hover:bg-gray-100 rounded-md transition-colors"
      >
        Products
      </a>
      <a
        href="/pricing"
        className="px-4 py-2 text-white bg-indigo-600 hover:bg-indigo-700 rounded-md transition-colors"
      >
        Pricing
      </a>
    </nav>
  )
}
`}</CodeBlock>

## Active Link Styling

Use the `pathname` prop available in layouts and pages to style active links:

<CodeBlock filename="src/app/layout.tsx" language="tsx">{`import type { LayoutProps } from 'rari'

export default function RootLayout({ children, pathname }: LayoutProps) {
  const isActive = (path: string) => pathname === path

  return (
    <div>
      <nav>
        <a
          href="/"
          className={isActive('/') ? 'text-indigo-600 font-semibold' : 'text-gray-700'}
        >
          Home
        </a>
        <a
          href="/about"
          className={isActive('/about') ? 'text-indigo-600 font-semibold' : 'text-gray-700'}
        >
          About
        </a>
      </nav>
      <main>{children}</main>
    </div>
  )
}
`}</CodeBlock>

For more complex active state logic, you can check if the pathname starts with a certain path:

<CodeBlock language="tsx">{`const isActiveSection = (path: string) => pathname?.startsWith(path)

<a
  href="/docs/getting-started"
  className={isActiveSection('/docs') ? 'active' : ''}
>
  Documentation
</a>
`}</CodeBlock>

## External Links

External links work exactly as you'd expect — they're not intercepted and perform normal browser navigation:

<CodeBlock language="tsx">{`export default function Footer() {
  return (
    <footer>
      <a href="https://github.com/your-repo" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">
        GitHub
      </a>
      <a href="https://twitter.com/your-handle" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">
        Twitter
      </a>
    </footer>
  )
}
`}</CodeBlock>

The router automatically detects external URLs and lets the browser handle them normally.

## Special Link Behaviors

### Hash Links

Hash links scroll to elements on the current page:

<CodeBlock language="tsx">{`<a href="#features">Jump to Features</a>

<section id="features">
  <h2>Features</h2>
</section>
`}</CodeBlock>

The router intercepts hash links and performs smooth scrolling to the target element.

### Download Links

Links with the `download` attribute are not intercepted:

<CodeBlock language="tsx">{`<a href="/files/report.pdf" download>
  Download Report
</a>
`}</CodeBlock>

### Modified Clicks

Links clicked with modifier keys (Ctrl, Cmd, Shift, Alt) are not intercepted, allowing users to open links in new tabs or windows as expected:

- `Cmd/Ctrl + Click` — Opens in new tab
- `Shift + Click` — Opens in new window
- `Alt + Click` — Downloads the link

### Target Attribute

Links with `target` attributes other than `_self` are not intercepted:

<CodeBlock language="tsx">{`<a href="/admin" target="_blank">
  Open Admin in New Tab
</a>
`}</CodeBlock>

## Prefetching

Currently, rari does not include automatic link prefetching. Navigation is fast enough with the streaming architecture and route caching that prefetching hasn't been necessary. This may be added in a future release based on user feedback.

## Why No Link Component?

The decision to use standard `<a>` tags instead of a custom component is intentional:

1. **Zero learning curve**: If you know HTML, you already know how to navigate
2. **Better DX**: No imports, no prop mapping, no framework-specific APIs
3. **Standards-based**: Works with any styling solution, accessibility tools, and browser features
4. **Less code**: Fewer abstractions mean less to maintain and debug
5. **Progressive enhancement**: Links work even if JavaScript fails to load

The client router handles all the complexity behind the scenes, giving you SPA-like navigation with the simplicity of static HTML.
